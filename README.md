<h1>Add To Cart Feature Using JavaScript</h1>

<p>This project is to strengthen my JavaScript skills.</p>
<p>First you have to click on the plus icon which is on the product card. This means you have added the product to the cart. Now click on the cart icon, which is on the top right corner of the page. You can now see the product you added.</p>

<p>Every time you click on a product and add it to the cart, you will have to click on the cart icon to check it.</p>
